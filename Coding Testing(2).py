x = 1

while x <=6:
    print(x)
    x = x + 1 #this equation is dynamic so it'll keep adding one to x until it reaches 6
             #once 6 has been reached then the value is false so the while loop stops
    #if we left it as x = 1 while x <=6: print(x)  it will read the variable one and forever print in the while loop cause its a true statement
