#Batch Operations in Python
user_prompt = 'Enter too dooo:'

while True:
    todo = input(user_prompt)
    print(todo)
    print("Next.........")

    #so with the while loop,python will check if the
    #while loop condition is true
    #then it will execute the next line
    #execute print(todo) and print(next)
    # then goes back to see if the while loop is true and
    ##goes through the todo line again
    #this has four loops in it

    #Instead of writing a custom-made condition that makes the while loop true
    #We can use while True(python built in prompt)
    #Intially, we have the while condition say "While 2>1'
    #True = Boolean and its kind of like a string
